If you're like me, you use ctrl+arrow keys to navigate your code, word by word. That said, it's a little annoying that this doesn't work with camel case. Turns out, VS Code actually has the ability to do "subword" navigation (i.e. jump between words in camel case) built in, it just isn't enabled. This extension enables camel case navigation by adding keymaps to these sub word navigation commands.

By default, it overwrites the default word navigation behavior with subword navigation (if the subword equivalent exists)

Basically this is an implementation of [this article's](https://www.damirscorner.com/blog/posts/20190726-CamelHumpsNavigationInVsCode.html) shortcuts as an extension for convenience.
