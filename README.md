If you're like me, you use ctrl+arrow keys to navigate your code, word by word. That said, it's a little annoying that this doesn't work with camel case. Turns out, this feature is built in to VS Code (where it's known as word part navigation), it just isn't enabled. This extension enables camel case navigation by adding keymaps to these sub word navigation commands.

By default, it overwrites the default word navigation behavior with subword navigation (if the subword equivalent exists)

Basically this is an implementation of [this article's](https://www.damirscorner.com/blog/posts/20190726-CamelHumpsNavigationInVsCode.html) shortcuts as an extension for convenience.
